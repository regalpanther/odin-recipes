    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <P><ul>Rice</ul>
    <ul>2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped</ul>
    <ul>Salt </ul>
    <ul>6 oz tomato paste (170 g), 1 can</ul>
    <ul>1 habanero pepper </ul>
    <ul>½ teaspoon mixed dried herbs</ul>
    <ul>Half a kpakpo shito (or hot pepper)</ul>

    <ul>10g garlic</ul>

</P>
<p>
    <h3>steps</h3>
</p>
       <ol> 
        <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li> Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li> Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
