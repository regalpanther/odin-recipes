    <img src="waakye.jpeg">  
    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <P>A traditional waakye, much like rice and peas, is almost always made with black-eyed peas or cowpeas. It's traditionally boiled with dried red sorghum leaves and an effervescent additive known as kanwa, a type of naturally occurring sodium-based salt.</P>
    <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
    <P><ul>Rice</ul>
    <ul>Beans</ul>
    <ul>Salt </ul>
    <ul>Sorghum leaves</ul>
    <ul>Meat</ul>
    <ul>Coconut oil</ul>
    <ul>Half a kpakpo shito (or hot pepper)</ul>
    <ul>10g ginger</ul>
    <ul>10g garlic</ul>
    <ul>2 onions</ul> 
</P>
<p>
    <h3>steps</h3>
</p>
       <ol> 
        <li>Place rice in a medium bowl, add water to cover, and swirl rice with your hand. Drain through a fine mesh strainer; return rice to bowl. Repeat process until water is clear when swirled with rice. Heat a large, heavy saucepan over medium. Add coconut oil and yellow onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are lightly browned around the edges, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>While onions cooks, swiftly rinse dried millet leaves under water because the color will start to run as soon as they get wet; cut into 3-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Add sliced chiles, black-eyed peas, millet leaves or baking soda, salt, and drained rice to onion mixture in pan, and stir to coat each grain of rice in oil. Stir in stock and bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12 minutes. Turn off heat and let stand, covered, until water is absorbed and rice is very tender, 8 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li> Prepare stew with meat.</li>
        <li> Serve the stew ladled over the rice. Top with eggs, chives, sesame seeds, avocado slices, Shito hot pepper sauce, chiles, and cilantro, if desired.  If you eat this for breakfast we'll make a Ghanaian out of you yet!</li>
